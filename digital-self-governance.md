# Digital Self-Governance
At the end of 2023, inspired by Steph Ango's personal philosophy, I began taking control of my digital life.

> If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, it's important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.

I've been ditching proprietary platforms in favour of something much simpler: plaintext. Every device can read and edit it.

By choosing accessible formats, I become less dependent on companies and the internet.

I now enjoy intentional offline time, and it's become my favourite part of the day.

These days, I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my editor—I enjoy its simple UI and devoted community. I know the tool won't last forever—and I don't need it to.
